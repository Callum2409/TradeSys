This script is example code for the use of TradeSys in your game. It is intended to show you how to get the different useful variables out of
the relevent scripts. There will be other ways of doing this, and better ways of displaying this information, but should hopefully be sufficient to
demonstrate the use and show you the methods and variables that store the required information.

I hope this is useful in creating your GUI!
